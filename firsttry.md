I'm really looking forward to meet all the Johnson 6.30 team. I'm really happy about the idea of working with some of them, because when we work as a team I think we can do better project with the ideas of different people, we can help each other if someone has a problem to solve and finally we can make a good atmosphere so everyone feel comfortable.
